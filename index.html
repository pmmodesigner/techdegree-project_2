            <p>Howdy, there!</p>
            <p>I'm a graphic designer learning front-end delvelopment. I have a background in print design that will aid me with a good eye on the digital front. I'm excited to start this new chapter of my visual communication career!</p>

            <h1 class="section_header">About</h1>
            <p>I'm Pedro Manuel, and I'm keen on design. Really—check out my design philosphy.</p>
            <p>Currently, I find myself at the precipice of the world of print graphic design and taking a leap into the world of the ever-important digital frontier of design.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I revel in sipping a fine espresso, listening to public radio, boogieing to a good beat, taking awe in the nighttime sky, preparing an experiential and nutritious meal, commuting via bicycle, tiring myself while hiking up a vista, consuming art, daydreaming infinities, and breathing in the sweetness of life.</p>

            <h2>Three design criteria…</h2>
            <p>Still a young designer, I've got a lifetime of learning in the craft of visual communication. However, I've discovered that I arrive to my work with a set of design criteria to yield powerful design work:</p>
            <p>I firmly believe that compelling visual communication occurs when it is clear, accessible, and impressive. Clear to immediately relay its message; so it should be simple. Accessible to make it relatable and understood; so it should be human. And impressive to engender a spirit of wonderment; so it should be artful.</p>
            <p>These three criteria have guided me to create design work that I believe communicates effectively and even viscerally.</p>
            <h3>Design is simple.</h3>
            <p>Every once in a while, I get a feeling that everything has become too much: a constant hum of a furnace, a spew of photos and drawings on a refrigerator, or a super sweet latte—not even potable.</p>
            <p>I surmise that supersaturation isn't desired.</p>
            <p>I am convinced that a plethora of words and objects in a design layout wouldn't allow me the ability to effortlessly gather the message being presented to me.</p>
            <p>Simplicity isn't a means of getting rid of something; it is a means of leaving the perfect amount of something—all to avoid the too much and to elevate the remaining into elegance.</p>
            <h3>Design is human.</h3>
            <p>Humans have developed language­—a way to effectively communicate.</p>
            <p>However, I propose that symbols have a greater emotional pull than language: symbols provide illustrations of human processes. For example, they give insight as to how a tribe hunted and survived via wall paintings, they demand auto drivers to stop via red octagons, and they even unify whole belief systems in a few straightforward shapes via pictograms.</p>
            <p>These ideas are easily conveyed without the mechanical syntax and lengthiness of language. Being mindful of regional cultural ideas, they allow elaborate concepts to become highly accesible to all persons.</p>
            <h3>Design is artful.</h3>
            <p>I see art as being a creative and expressive experience. An experience derived from an artist's intention and a viewer's interpretation. And due to this dichotomy of artist intention versus viewer interpretation, it is a way to connect at a profound level by holding a dialogue with a silent, unknown other.</p>
            <p>It is at this dialogue where truths may be murmured; where emotions may be stirred; where divides may be bridged; and where minds may be marveled. Pieces of artwork comprise a network of all of the creations and expressions made by mankind. They become the cultural identity of our human race.</p>
            <p>This makes it imperative that all of my works should be made with craft and consideration for my viewers' interpretation.</p>

            <p>I started my design career clear back in middle school. For some reason, I always found myself attracted to the package design of the groceries that my papá and mamá brought home from the market.</p>
            <p>Realizing that my high school offered a computer arts class, I signed up at once.</p>
            <p>Delving into photo manipulation, typography, pre-press, and some identity work, I was fortunate enough to start competing with other high schools state-wide and nationally. In 2009, I was honored with a second place award in Advertising Design at the National Leadership and Skills Conference in Kansas City, MO.</p>
            <p>I proceeded to college at Idaho State University with a major in mass communication with an emphasis in graphic design.</p>
            <p>In college, I took up a job designing posters for student body functions. And after college, I was offered a position at a local print shop, solidifying my print and pre-press skills. Later, I worked for a sign studio in Sun Valley, Idaho—taking my print skills into the third dimension. Currently, I'm employed by a nationally ranked newspaper as a layout editor.</p>
            <p>And now I'm ready to propell myself from a print space to a digital one, visually communicating for future clients with my newly acquired coding skills on websites and applications.</p>
